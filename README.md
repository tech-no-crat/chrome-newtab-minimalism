## Installation
Download the zip & uncompress it. Go to Chrome's settings page > Extensions (or just type [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)). Turn on the *Developer Mode*. Click *Load unpacked extension*, browse to the uncompressed folder and select it. Done!

If you ever want your old new tab page back, just disable the extension's checkbox from the [extensions page](chrome://extensions) or remove it completely.
